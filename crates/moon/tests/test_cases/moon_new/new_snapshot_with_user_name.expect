# Git Hooks

## Pre-commit Hook

This pre-commit hook performs automatic checks before finalizing your commit.

### Usage Instructions

To use this pre-commit hook:

1. Make the hook executable if it isn't already:
   ```bash
   chmod +x .githooks/pre-commit
   ```

2. Configure Git to use the hooks in the .githooks directory:
   ```bash
   git config core.hooksPath .githooks
   ```

3. The hook will automatically run when you execute `git commit`

      # If you want to clone the repository as part of your setup steps, for example to install dependencies, you'll need the `contents: read` permission. If you don't clone the repository in your setup steps, Copilot will do this for you automatically after the steps complete.

    # You can define any steps you want, and they will run before the agent starts.
