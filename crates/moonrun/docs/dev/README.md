# Contributing Quick Start

## How to Build and Test

```bash
cargo build
cargo test
```

## Before PR

We encourage to add the following prefix to your commit message and PR title: feat, fix, internal, or minor.

It's recommended to run the following command before you submit a PR, which may help discover some potential ci failure ASAP

```bash
cargo fmt

cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings

cargo test
```

We use [typos](https://github.com/crate-ci/typos) to avoid potential typos, you can also download and run it locally before PR.
